              The difference between this impl. and the previous is that, rather 
               than creating and retaining a matrix of size s.length()+1 by t.length()+1, 
               we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of length s.length()+1.  The first, d,
               is the 'current working' distance array that maintains the newest distance cost
               counts as we iterate through the characters of String s.  Each time we increment
               the index of String t we are comparing, d is copied to p, the second int[].  Doing so
               allows us to retain the previous cost counts as required by the algorithm (taking 
               the minimum of the cost count to the left, up one, and diagonally up and to the left
               of the current cost count being calculated).  (Note that the arrays aren't really 
               copied anymore, just switched...this is clearly much better than cloning an array 
               or doing a System.arraycopy() each time  through the outer loop.)

               Effectively, the difference between the two implementations is this one does not 
               cause an out of memory condition when calculating the LD over two very large strings.
